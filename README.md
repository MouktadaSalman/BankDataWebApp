# Bank Dashboard Web Application

## Project Overview
The Bank Dashboard Web Application is an ASP.NET Core MVC-based web app designed to provide a structured and secure banking experience for both users and administrators. It follows a two-tier architecture, separating the application into a business layer that exposes web services and a presentation layer that serves the user interface.

## Project Architecture
This project utilizes the data web service built in tutorial 7 and expands upon it by creating a standalone ASP.NET Core MVC application. The architecture consists of two primary layers:

### 1. Business Layer (Web Services)
- This layer handles all business logic, data processing, and database interactions.
- It is accessible via the `/api/` endpoint.
- Implements RESTful web services using ASP.NET Web API.
- Provides APIs for retrieving user account information, processing money transfers, and fetching transaction history.
- Returns responses in JSON format.

### 2. Presentation Layer (Web UI)
- This layer serves as the user interface of the application.
- Accessible through the root `/` endpoint.
- Built using ASP.NET MVC, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Uses JavaScript (via Fetch API or Axios) to communicate with the business layer asynchronously.
- Dynamically updates UI components based on API responses.

### 3. Home Controller (Integration Point)
- Renders the initial webpage when users access the root URL (`localhost:port/`).
- Serves the HTML structure and includes JavaScript files.
- JavaScript files interact with the business layer APIs to fetch and display user data.
